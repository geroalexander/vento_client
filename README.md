# Vento
## Client Repo
> This is the client side, for the [server](https://github.com/geroalexander/vento_server) side, navigate to another repository.

Vento is a lightweight application built for small and medium sized restaurant kitchens, that combines an inventory management system with a task organiser.
1. Communications within the kitchen team, making handovers during shift change and shift end *fluid and reliable*.
2. Improving the efficency of each individual kitchen section by *providing an overview* of the required tasks to be completed.
3. Contributing to higher job satisfaction by adressing the serious lack of IT solutions for *back of house* hospitality operations.
